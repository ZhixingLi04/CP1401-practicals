# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I watched about 80 percent of the video lectures.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I planned to watch most of them at home before attending the class, usually the day before class, 
and sometimes in the study room after class. In the end, I watched them for more than half an hour at a time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

First of all, I think I can finish the homework in time. 
Secondly, I will watch the lecture video in advance. I will continue to insist on both things.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

 I sometimes write exercises without checking for errors, so that my program may make mistakes, I change it, I want to learn error checking.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Sometimes when I do exercises, I don't read the questions carefully, and there are information errors or logic errors. 
Therefore, I will change it in the future to make the examination accurate.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I think the best thing about me is the punctuality of my homework submission. I will submit most of my homework on time or even ahead of schedule. 
In addition to this, the completeness of the exercises I wrote is also very good.
